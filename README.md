## ‚ú® How It Works
Cortex operates on a few core principles to autonomously solve programming challenges.

| Concept                | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üß† Autonomous Reasoning | Utilizes a ReAct (Reason + Act) framework to think step-by-step, analyzing errors and planning corrections without human intervention.        |
| üõ°Ô∏è Secure Execution    | All generated code is executed in an isolated Docker container, preventing any access to your local system and ensuring safety.               |
| üé® Thought Visualization | Translates its internal monologue into abstract art using the FLUX.1 image model, offering a unique glimpse into the AI's "Chain of Thought". |
| üîå LLM Agnostic         | Powered by LiteLLM, Cortex is compatible with over 100 LLMs, including specialized models like Mistral Codestral and high-speed providers like Groq. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.9+ and Docker must be installed and running.

1. **Clone & Configure**  
   Clone the repository and set up your environment file.  
   Add your API key (e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY` or `MISTRAL_API_KEY`) inside `.env`.

2. **Build the Sandbox**  
   Build the secure Docker image for code execution (one-time setup).

3. **Install & Run**  
   Create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and launch the application.
